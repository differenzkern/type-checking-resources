# helpful resources for implementing a type checker

## pattern unification
- [Chapter 4 and Appendix C of Type Inference, Haskell and Dependent Types](https://adam.gundry.co.uk/pub/thesis/thesis-2013-12-03.pdf)
- [Chapter 3 of Andras Kovac's elaboration-zoo](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/elaboration-zoo/tree/master/03-holes)
## normalization by evaluation
- https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/implementing-types-hs.pdf (there is also a racket version on their webpage but I find the haskell version better digestable by at least an order of magnitude)

## hindley milner type inference
- some carnegie mellon ocaml course that always includes a chapter/tutorial about hindley milner inference, but which I can't find right now
